								Cloud native revolutionized the way we look at app development and is now one of the most popular programming architectures. OpenShift alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of these microservices. Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade orchestration for your microservices. In this workshop, you’ll get an overview of Kubernetes, and move directly into leveraging OpenShift to what it provides for application development. You’ll then go through the process of building and deploying a microservice application in this cloud native way. This is a hands-on-keyboard lab, everyone should come with a laptop and a desire to learn. Attendees can use OpenShift locally, but would prefer the free IBM cloud resources that will be provided.

								Who should attend: Anyone interested in getting a hands on overview of Kubernetes, and the advantages of using OpenShift instead of vanilla Kubernetes, whether they are interested in developing for the platform, or may need to support folks that are.
								Take back to work: The take away should be a firm understanding of the Kubernetes environment and using OpenShift’s workflow, and how one develops for it. It aims to expose some of the benefits of the platform so that people who are evaluating bringing it into their environment can have a deeper sense of what application development looks like on it.

								Simply said, the software that runs a significant amount of the world is being left behind. Kubernetes owns the mind share of the next generation of applications, and legacy applications are getting farther and farther behind. There is hesitation around moving these legacy applications to this new control plane and compute platform. These applications were developed at a time when there was a consistent way of developing software allowing Developers to focus on the business value instead of the Operations requirements. In this talk, I’ll walk through what I thought was originally a joke of a project that became a perfect litmus test of why any developed application can run on this unified platform. With a measured amount of engineering effort, your company can move any language and any developed application to Kubernetes, gaining the power of both the shared control plane and Cloud-Native velocity of development.

								Over the last decade, I’ve had the privilege professionally of building and cultivating some Open Source projects and communities. To start off this isn’t a tools talk, this is a talk about the soft skills you have to have to be able to succeed as a leader in an Open Source project. My journey started tending the frequently asked questions for a small Linux Distribution called CRUX, and then years later professionally moved to the OpenStack-Chef project to build OpenStack clouds. I’ve grown other projects along the way helped build tooling and communities some successful and still running today, others were just flashes in the pan.  I’ve learned a ton on this journey; honestly still am, but I have some lessons that are hard learned and hopefully I warn pitfalls that can cause wasted cycles and pain.
								I’ll be going over:

								In the modern day SDDC, the ability to create a VM or template consistent, repeatable, and streamlined is a requirement. Using open source projects like Packer, Ansible, and InSpec you can build this nirvana. Using Packer to create a template, Ansible to do your configuration management, and then trigger InSpec scanning of your compliance policies all on vSphere. In this talk, we will walk through the required foundational knowledge to build this pipeline. In this talk you’ll learn:

								Part of the job of a Developer Advocate is the ability to demo or show off portions of your technology stack to possible users. At IBM this is no different for us, but there is a gap on the scale of what our requirements are and what the provisioning of our cloud infrastructure was. In this talk we will describe our situation, our iterations on what we tried and the painful portions of them, and how we accidentally created a Cloud interface on top of the IBM Cloud, or easier said, we created a Cloud on our Cloud. 

								Ideally, we’ll show our journey and the lessons we learned along the way, and as an audience member, you’ll come away with nuggets of useful tooling to make your cloud usage more streamlined, and hopefully, you’ll see the pitfalls we fell in and you can avoid them yourself. We’ll show off some bad code, some good code, and some robust code; all open source and available to allow you to leverage it too.
