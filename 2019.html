This could be a lighting talk. I want to be able to talk to people that not only identify as an introvert, but people with social anxiety too. Conferences and large groups of people are scary to people who identify as introverts and can miss out on a lot of experiences.

In new generation of software development, also known as Cloud Native, it simply requires pipelines to be successful. You need to have a comfort blanket for your development, which is the main why CD/CI are so prevalent in our industry now. There are multiple ways to create a standarized pipelne and luckily there is already some good starting points to get yourself bootstrapped.
This talk will give you the building blocks to use IBMs on premise Kubernetes offering also known as IBM Cloud private (ICP) and an open source version control management solution called Gitlab. We will walk through using Kubernetes building a way to have a shared Git repository and use the Auto-DevOps runners both on behind a firewall and public IBM Kubernetes service to verify your code. You will walk away with enough knowledge to create a pipeline that will give you the confidence for your code to get you to the velocity that you want.

Cloud native revolutionized the way we look at app development and is now one of the most popular programming architectures. OpenShift alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of these microservices. Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade orchestration for your microservices. In this workshop, you’ll get an overview of Kubernetes, and move directly into leveraging OpenShift to what it provides for application development. You’ll then go through the process of building and deploying a microservice application in this cloud native way. This is a hands-on-keyboard lab, everyone should come with a laptop and a desire to learn. Attendees can use OpenShift locally, but would prefer the free IBM cloud resources that will be provided.

<p>
Who should attend: Anyone interested in getting a hands on overview of Kubernetes, and the advantages of using OpenShift instead of vanilla Kubernetes, whether they are interested in developing for the platform, or may need to support folks that are.
Take back to work: The take away should be a firm understanding of the Kubernetes environment and using OpenShift’s workflow, and how one develops for it. It aims to expose some of the benefits of the platform so that people who are evaluating bringing it into their environment can have a deeper sense of what application development looks like on it.

<p>
With Kubernetes owning the mind share of the next generation of applications, legacy applications are getting farther and farther behind. There is hesitation around moving these legacy applications to this new control plane and platform. They were developed at a time when there was a specific and consistent way of developing software allowing Developers to focus on the business value instead of the Operations requirements. The world is quickly moving on, and the software that runs a significant amount of the world is being left behind. This talk, I’ll walk through what I thought was originally a joke of a project, that became a perfect litmus test of why any developed application can run on this unified platform. With a measured amount of engineering effort, your company can move any language and any developed application to Kubernetes, gaining the power of both the shared control plane and Cloud Native velocity of development.

Microservices revolutionized the way we look at app development and is now one of the most popular programming architectures. Now, Docker alongside Kubernetes is changing the way teams look at deployments of these microservices. Kubernetes provides powerful production-grade orchestration for your “Dockerized” microservices.
In this workshop, you’ll get an overview of Kubernetes, and what it provides for application development. You’ll then go through the process of building and deploying a microservice application on Kubernetes.
This is a hands-on-keyboard lab, everyone should come with a laptop and a desire to learn. Attendees can use minikube locally, or cloud accounts will be provided. We’ll cover:

You see this cloud-native thing creep into some conversations. You are starting to see your boss reading this Kubernetes book. You’ve googled around about both, but all the terms and technology is hard to grasp. Luckily this talk I’ll walk through in 20 slides everything you need to know about Kubernetes to be dangerous. From there you can take it and focus on what you need to know and start discovering it for yourself.

Istio is a new open platform to connect, manage, and secure micro-services jointly launched by IBM, Google, and Lyft. This session will provide a technical overview of the Istio project and demonstrations of using Istio with microservices and Kubernetes. Specifically: Service mesh - what it is, why, and who is using it Making the deployment more secure (Using istio to get mutual tls authentication between services) Rolling out a new version to 1% of users (Using istio for traffic splitting) Making the deployment more robust (Using istio for circuit breaking and automatic request retries) Controlling the front door (Using Istio-ingressgateway instead of default Kubernetes Ingress)

<p>
Over the last decade, I’ve had the privilege professionally of building and cultivating some Open Source projects and communities. To start off this isn’t a tools talk, this is a talk about the soft skills you have to have to be able to succeed as a leader in an Open Source project. My journey started tending the frequently asked questions for a small Linux Distribution called CRUX, and then years later professionally moved to the OpenStack-Chef project to build OpenStack clouds. I’ve grown other projects along the way helped build tooling and communities some successful and still running today, others were just flashes in the pan.  I’ve learned a ton on this journey; honestly still am, but I have some lessons that are hard learned and hopefully I warn pitfalls that can cause wasted cycles and pain.

Using open source projects like Packer, Ansible, and InSpec you can build this nirvana. Using Packer to create a template, Ansible to do your configuration management, and then trigger InSpec scanning of your compliance policies all on vSphere.
